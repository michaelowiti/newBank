# FlatIron Bank

#### Created By Michael Owiti 



## Description

For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a

list of your recent bank transactions, among other features.

## Core Deliverables
As a user, I can:

See a table of all transactions.

 Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table *the new transaction does not have to be persisted to the backend*

Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.

## Bonus Deliverables

These bonus deliverables are here if you want an extra challenge and won't affect your score. Make sure to commit your work to save your progress before attempting the bonus deliverables!

As a user, I should be able to:

- Sort transactions alphabetically by category or description.

- Delete a transaction which will remove it from the table

## Setup Requirements

-Once you have the plan in place for the application you want to build take the following steps:

-Create a new project folder
-Create a new GitHub repository (NB: ENSURE IT IS PRIVATE).
-Add your TM as a contributor to the project. (This is only for grading purposes. We promise we won't steal your code)
-Please make sure you regularly commit to the repository.
